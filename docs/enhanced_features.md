# Enhanced Features Design Update

Based on the user's additional requirements, this document outlines the enhanced features to be incorporated into the semi-dating Telegram bot for Saudi Arabia and GCC nationals.

## Mutual Matching Mechanism

### Check/X Mark System

- **Interface Design**: 
  - Simple ✓/✗ buttons displayed with each potential match
  - Confirmation prompt before final decision
  - Limited daily number of check marks to encourage thoughtful selection

### Group Creation Process
1. User A selects check mark for User B
2. User B selects check mark for User A
3. System detects mutual interest
4. Notification sent to both users about the match
5. Group chat automatically created with both users
6. Welcome message with conversation starters sent to the group
7. Optional family member addition to the group based on settings
