## Data Model

### Primary Entities
1. **Users**: Core user information and account status
2. **Profiles**: Detailed user profile information
3. **FamilyMembers**: Family connections and permissions
4. **Matches**: Match relationships and status
5. **Conversations**: Message history and metadata
6. **Reports**: Moderation reports and resolutions
7. **SuccessStories**: Positive outcomes and testimonials
8. **Settings**: User preferences and configurations

### Relationships
- Users have one Profile
- Users can have multiple FamilyMembers
- Users can have multiple Matches with other Users
- Matches contain multiple Conversations
- Users can submit multiple Reports
- Users can have multiple SuccessStories
- Users have one Settings record
